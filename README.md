# Lumina.Excel

Contains generated definitions for relational Excel data used in FINAL FANTASY XIV. Git tags match game versions, tracking the global client. While these may work for regional variants, no support is provided.

## Repo Overview

* `deps` - additional dependencies for the generator
  * `EXDSchema` - the YAML schema definitions used to generate Lumina.Excel helper classes
  * `Lumina` - the Lumina library used as a dependency to Lumina.Excel (TODO: Remove this once [the PR](https://github.com/NotAdam/Lumina/pull/88) is merged)
  * `Lumina-sourcegen` - a heavily modified fork to port Lumina to .NET standard 2.0. This isn't heavily tested whatsoever, but it works for the purposes of Lumina.Excel
* `src` - generator, generated code & tooling documentation
  * `Lumina.Excel` - the project to store helper classes generated from the schema. This folder is mostly empty, as all of it's containing code is generated by the source generator.
  * `Lumina.Excel.Generator` - the source generator project that generates the helper classes. Has more functionality than is currently used. More documentation soon™️.
  * `Lumina.SpaghettiGenerator` - deprecated generator project that uses SaintCoinach schemas instead of EXDSchema.
  * `Lumina.SpaghettiUpdater` - deprecated (but not obsoleted by anything yet) project that detects and updates SaintCoinach schemas between different FFXIV versions.
